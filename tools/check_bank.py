"""Audit the written question bank without opening a browser.

Every other suite here drives headless Chrome, which means that on a machine
where Chrome will not start there is nothing at all standing between a bad
question and the Play Store. This one needs only JavaScriptCore, which ships
with macOS, so it still runs when check.py can do nothing but report timeouts.

It reads CATS straight out of index.html — bracket-matched, not regexed, because
a regex over 600k of nested literals undercounted 2,406 questions as 397 — hands
it to jsc, and checks the plain structural promises the game relies on, plus the
four things that are invisible in a diff: a question pointing at a picture that
does not exist, a question that contains its own answer, an option set where the
answer is the only long one, and the same question asked twice in different
words.

  python3 tools/check_bank.py          # non-zero exit if anything failed

Findings are split: an error is a question the engine can mishandle, a warning is
one a player can beat without knowing the answer. A warning that has been looked
at and judged fair goes in ACCEPTED with its reason, because three warnings that
print on every run are how you learn to stop reading the output — the same
argument check.py makes for not calling a Chrome timeout a failure. ACCEPTED is
keyed on the exact question text, so rewording one retires its excuse and the
warning comes back.
