"""Gemini image-to-image test: repaint a few player photos as painterly
editorial / gouache realism, into a separate test folder.

Nothing in img/ is touched. The script reads the photos the album uses, sends
each one with the style prompt to a Gemini image model, and writes the
results — plus the originals and a side-by-side sheet — to OUT.

Environment:
  GEMINI_API_KEY  required; read from the environment and never printed
  GEMINI_MODEL    image model id (default gemini-3-pro-image-preview)
  STYLE           atelier_full (default: run 3's brushwork, full bleed), atelier (dissolving into
                  bare paper) or gouache (smooth editorial gouache, edge to edge)
  PLAYERS         comma-separated album ids (default: five representative ones)
  OUT             output folder (default ai-test/local)
